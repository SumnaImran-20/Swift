CREATING AN EMPTY ARRAY
---Code---
//Integer Data type
var NUMBER: [Int] = [] 
print("NUMBER is of type [Int] with \(NUMBER.count) items.") 

//Double Data type
var DoubleNumber: [Double] = []
print("DoubleNumber is of type [Double] with \(DoubleNumber.count) items.")

---Output---
NUMBER is of type [Int] with 0 items.
DoubleNumber is of type [Double] with 0 items.

//INSERTING ELEMENTS INTO ARRAY
---Code---
var DoubleNumber: [Double] = []
DoubleNumber.append(3.2)
print("Array: \(DoubleNumber)")
print("DoubleNumber is of type [Double] with \(DoubleNumber.count) items.")
---Output---
Array: [3.2]
DoubleNumber is of type [Double] with 1 items.

//CREATING AN ARRAY WITH A DEFAULT VALUE
---Code---
var threeDoubles = Array(repeating: 2.0, count: 5)
print(threeDoubles)
---Output---
[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]

---Code---
print("---Addition of two array---")
var threeDoubles = Array(repeating: 2.0, count: 5)
print("First Array: \(threeDoubles)")
var anotherThreeDoubles = Array(repeating: 2.5, count: 3)
print("Second Array: \(anotherThreeDoubles)")
var sixDoubles = threeDoubles + anotherThreeDoubles
print("Addition is: \(sixDoubles)")
print("Size of array is: \(sixDoubles.count)")
---Output---
---Addition of two array---
First Array: [2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]
Second Array: [2.5, 2.5, 2.5]
Addition is: [2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5]
Size of array is: 8

---Code---
var shoppingList: [String] = ["Eggs", "Milk"] 
print("Array is: \(shoppingList)")
print("The shopping list contains \(shoppingList.count) items.")
---Output---
Array is: ["Eggs", "Milk"]
The shopping list contains 2 items.


//ACCESSING AND MODIFYING AN ARRAY
---Code---
if shoppingList.isEmpty { 
print("The shopping list is empty.") 
} else { 
print("The shopping list isn't empty.") 
}
// Prints "The shopping list isn't empty."

shoppingList.append("Flour") 
// shoppingList now contains 3 items, and someone is making pancakes

shoppingList += ["Baking Powder"] 
// shoppingList now contains 4 items

shoppingList += ["Chocolate Spread", "Cheese", "Butter"] 
// shoppingList now contains 7 items

shoppingList[4...6] = ["Bananas", "Apples"] 
// shoppingList now contains 6 items

shoppingList.insert("Maple Syrup", at: 0) 
// shoppingList now contains 7 items
// "Maple Syrup" is now the first item in the list
